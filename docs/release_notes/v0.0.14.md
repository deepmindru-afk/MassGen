# v0.0.14 – Release Notes

## New Feature: Claude Code Answer Version Logging

### Feature Overview
A new logging capability has been added to automatically save every version of answers provided by Claude Code. This feature ensures comprehensive tracking and preservation of all generated answers from Claude Code Agent, enabling better traceability and version control.

### Storage Structure
Answer versions are organized in the following directory hierarchy:

```
massgen_logs/
└── log_{timestamp}/
    ├── agent_outputs/
    │   ├── agent_id.txt
    │   ├── final_presentation_agent_id.txt
    │   └── system_status.txt
    ├── agent_id/
    │   └── {answer_generation_timestamp}/
    │       └── files_included_in_generated_answer
    ├── final_workspace/
    │   └── agent_id/
    │       └── {answer_generation_timestamp}/
    │           └── files_included_in_generated_answer
    └── massgen.log
```

#### Directory Structure Explanation\
- `log_{timestamp}`: Main log directory identified by session timestamp
- `agent_outputs/`: Contains text outputs from each agent
  - `agent_id.txt`: Raw output from each agent
  - `final_presentation_agent_id.txt`: Final presentation for the selected agent
  - `system_status.txt`: System status information
- `agent_id/`: Directory for each agent containing answer versions
  - `{answer_generation_timestamp}/`: Timestamp directory for each answer version
    - `files_included_in_generated_answer`: All relevant files in that version
- `final_workspace/`: Final presentation for agents
  - `agent_id/`: Agent-specific directory in final workspace
    - `{answer_generation_timestamp}/`: Timestamp directory for each answer version
      - `files_included_in_generated_answer`: All relevant files in that version
- `massgen.log`: Main log file

### Important Note
The final answer continues to be stored in each Claude Code Agent's workspace as before. After generating the final presentation, the relevant files will be copied to the `final_workspace/` directory.

### Key Benefits
1. **Version Tracking** – Track the evolution of each answer through multiple iterations  
2. **Historical Recovery** – Access previous answer versions when needed  
3. **Comparative Analysis** – Easily compare differences between different versions  
4. **Complete Audit Trail** – Maintain full generation history for debugging and optimization  

### Use Cases
- Reviewing historical Claude Code generation records  
- Analyzing and comparing answer quality across versions
