## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **MCP Protocol Specification**: Official Model Context Protocol specification
- **Claude Code Backend**: Existing Claude Code integration infrastructure
- **Claude Backend**: Current Claude API integration
- **Backend Architecture**: Existing backend abstraction layer
- **Configuration System**: YAML/JSON configuration management

### Risks & Mitigations
1. **MCP Protocol Complexity**: *Mitigation*: Start with core MCP features, incrementally add advanced capabilities
2. **Tool Compatibility**: *Mitigation*: Implement robust tool validation and error handling
3. **Performance Overhead**: *Mitigation*: Efficient MCP message processing and caching
4. **Security Concerns**: *Mitigation*: Implement MCP authentication and tool permission management
5. **Breaking Changes**: *Mitigation*: Maintain backward compatibility with non-MCP configurations

## Post-v0.0.9 Considerations

### Future Enhancements (v0.1.0+)
- **Custom MCP Servers**: Framework for building custom MCP servers
- **MCP Marketplace**: Community MCP tool sharing platform
- **Advanced Tool Chains**: Complex multi-tool workflows via MCP
- **Cross-Platform MCP**: MCP support across all backends

### Long-term Vision
- **Universal Tool Protocol**: MCP as the standard for AI tool integration
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of MCP-compatible tools
