      cwd: "agent_workspace"
      context_paths:
        - path: "C:/Users/project/src/styles"
          permission: "write"  # Can modify original files
        - path: "C:/Users/project/public/index.html"
          permission: "read"   # Reference only
```

#### 1.2 Use Case Coverage (REQUIRED)

### üéØ Milestone 2: Workspace Mirroring & Permission System (REQUIRED)
**Goal**: Complete intelligent workspace structure that mirrors original file organization with permission-based access control

#### 2.1 Workspace Structure Mirroring (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Finalize automatic common root detection for clean workspace organization
- [ ] Complete path stripping to avoid deep nesting when possible
- [ ] Ensure full path structure preservation for different roots/drives
- [ ] Validate workspace mirroring of original project structure

**Common Root Example**:
```
# Input paths all under C:/Users/project/
workspace/
  src/
    main.css           # Modified version
  components/
    Header.jsx         # Modified version
  package.json         # Reference copy
```

**Cross-Drive Example**:
```
# Input paths from C:/ and D:/ drives
workspace/
  C/Users/website/src/main.css
  D/projects/shared/utils.js
```

#### 2.2 Permission Management System (REQUIRED)

- [ ] Complete read permission implementation for reference-only files
- [ ] Finalize write permission implementation for modifiable files

- [ ] Implement automatic conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Add rollback capability for failed operations

### üéØ Milestone 3: Grok MCP Support (REQUIRED)

#### 3.2 Tool Discovery and Execution (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Implement dynamic tool discovery from MCP servers
- [ ] Add tool capability negotiation for Grok backend
- [ ] Create tool execution pipeline with proper error handling
- [ ] Ensure tool result formatting compatible with Grok responses
- [ ] Add tool usage logging and monitoring

#### 3.3 Grok MCP Configuration (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Add Grok MCP configuration options to YAML
- [ ] Implement MCP server specification in agent configs
- [ ] Create Grok-specific MCP settings and parameters
- [ ] Add validation for Grok MCP configurations
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with non-MCP Grok usage

#### 3.4 Integration Testing (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Test Grok MCP with common MCP servers (filesystem, git, etc.)
- [ ] Validate tool chaining and complex workflows
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Test performance with multiple concurrent MCP operations
- [ ] Validate logging and debugging capabilities

### üéØ Milestone 4: Enhanced Debugging & Display (OPTIONAL)
**Goal**: Improve terminal display handling for long outputs and enhance debugging experience

#### 4.1 Scroll Support Implementation (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Detect when output exceeds terminal height
- [ ] Implement scrollable view with keyboard navigation
