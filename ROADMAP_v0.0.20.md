## Key Milestones

### üéØ Milestone 1: Context Path Configuration (REQUIRED)
**Goal**: Enable agents to access user-specified files and folders with explicit permission control

#### 1.1 Configuration-Based File Access (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Add `context_paths` field to agent configuration with path and permission settings
- [ ] Enable referencing files in-place without copying to save disk space
- [ ] Support both single files and entire directories
- [ ] Handle cross-drive and cross-project paths seamlessly

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
agents:
  - id: "web_developer"
    backend:
      type: "claude_code"
      cwd: "agent_workspace"
      context_paths:
        - path: "C:/Users/project/src/styles"
          permission: "write"  # Can modify original files
        - path: "C:/Users/project/public/index.html"
          permission: "read"   # Reference only
```

#### 1.2 Use Case Coverage (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Single file editing with direct modification capability
- [ ] Single project folder access for comprehensive updates
- [ ] Multiple files from same project with mixed permissions
- [ ] Cross-project integration with files from different locations
- [ ] Cross-drive operations for complex migration tasks

### üéØ Milestone 2: Workspace Mirroring & Permission System (REQUIRED)
**Goal**: Create intelligent workspace structure that mirrors original file organization with permission-based access control

#### 2.1 Workspace Structure Mirroring (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Automatic common root detection for clean workspace organization
- [ ] Strip common paths to avoid deep nesting when possible
- [ ] Preserve full path structure when files come from different roots/drives
- [ ] Create workspace that mirrors original project structure
- [ ] Maintain clear mapping between workspace and original locations

**Common Root Example**:
```
# Input paths all under C:/Users/project/
workspace/
  src/
    main.css           # Modified version
  components/
    Header.jsx         # Modified version
  package.json         # Reference copy
```

**Cross-Drive Example**:
```
# Input paths from C:/ and D:/ drives
workspace/
  C/Users/website/src/main.css
  D/projects/shared/utils.js
```

#### 2.2 Permission Management System (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Implement read permission for reference-only files
- [ ] Implement write permission for modifiable files
- [ ] Track permission metadata for each context path
- [ ] Enforce permissions during final file application
- [ ] Prevent unintended changes to sensitive files

#### 2.3 Safe Development Workflow (REQUIRED)
- [ ] All changes develop in isolated workspace first
- [ ] Final agent applies changes based on write permissions
- [ ] No file copying required - reference originals in-place
- [ ] Automatic conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Rollback capability for failed operations

### üéØ Milestone 3: Advanced MCP Logging Organization (OPTIONAL)
**Goal**: Build upon v0.0.19 MCP logging with enhanced structure and diagnostics

#### 3.1 Hierarchical Log Structure (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Implement tree-based log visualization for MCP operations
- [ ] Add operation context with parent-child relationships
- [ ] Create indented log format for better readability
- [ ] Add timestamp and duration for each operation

#### 3.2 MCP Performance Metrics (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Success/failure rate calculation per server
- [ ] Request throughput monitoring
- [ ] Tool usage frequency analysis

#### 3.3 Enhanced Error Diagnostics (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Detailed error context with full stack traces
- [ ] Retry attempt logging with exponential backoff details
- [ ] Common error pattern detection
- [ ] Suggested fixes in error messages

### üéØ Milestone 4: Enhanced Debugging & Display (OPTIONAL)
**Goal**: Improve terminal display handling for long outputs and enhance debugging experience

#### 4.1 Scroll Support Implementation (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Detect when output exceeds terminal height
- [ ] Implement scrollable view with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add scroll indicators (position bar, line numbers)
- [ ] Support for different terminal emulators

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- Arrow keys: Line-by-line scrolling
- Page Up/Down: Page scrolling
- Home/End: Jump to start/end
- `/`: Search within output
- `n`/`N`: Next/previous search result

#### 4.2 Long Output Handling (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Smart truncation with "show more" functionality
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling for wide content (tables, code)
- [ ] Content folding for repetitive sections
- [ ] Export to file option for very long outputs

#### 4.3 Debug Display Enhancement (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Color-coded debug levels for quick identification
- [ ] Collapsible debug sections to reduce clutter
- [ ] Debug message filtering by component
- [ ] Debug session recording and replay

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Context path configuration with read/write permission control
- [ ] Workspace mirroring with common root detection and cross-drive support
- [ ] In-place file referencing without copying for disk space efficiency

### Functional Requirements (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Enhanced MCP logging with hierarchical structure
- [ ] Scroll support for long generated results
- [ ] Enhanced debug display with filtering
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for output browsing
- [ ] Export functionality for long outputs

### Performance Requirements (REQUIRED)
- [ ] File handling supports files up to 100MB
- [ ] No performance degradation with multiple files

- **Claude MCP Support**: Implement MCP capabilities for Claude backend with native Anthropic tools
- **Universal MCP Coverage**: Achieve all MCP support across all backend providers
- **MCP Server Marketplace**: Curated collection of pre-configured MCP servers for common use cases
- **Advanced MCP Analytics**: Real-time dashboard for MCP performance monitoring and optimization
