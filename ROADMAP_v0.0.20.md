- [ ] Add `--dir` argument for directory input
- [ ] Implement file validation and existence checking
- [ ] Support both relative and absolute paths
- [ ] Add file size limits and security validation

**Example Commands**:
```bash
# Single file
massgen --config config.yaml --file document.pdf "Summarize this document"

# Multiple files
massgen --config config.yaml --files file1.txt,file2.py,image.png "Analyze these files"

# Directory
massgen --config config.yaml --dir ./project "Review this codebase"
```

#### 1.2 File Format Support (REQUIRED)

### üéØ Milestone 2: Temporary File Management (REQUIRED)
**Goal**: Implement organized storage system for user-provided files

#### 2.1 Directory Structure Implementation (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Create `.massgen/temp/` base directory
- [ ] Implement session-based subdirectories with timestamps
- [ ] Create separate folders for user files and processed content
- [ ] Add file size limits: e.g. 10MB per file, 100MB total per session

**Directory Structure Example**:
```
.massgen/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ temp/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session_[timestamp]_[uuid]/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_files/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file1.txt
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file2.py
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image.png
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processed/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ extracted_text.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json
```

#### 2.2 Session Management (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Automatic session ID generation with timestamp
- [ ] File tracking with original paths and sizes
- [ ] Session metadata recording (start time, user, config)
- [ ] Concurrent session support without conflicts

#### 2.3 Cleanup Mechanisms (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Auto-cleanup after session completion
- [ ] Configurable retention period (default: 7 days)
- [ ] Manual cleanup command (`massgen --cleanup`)
- [ ] Size-based cleanup when storage exceeds limit

### üéØ Milestone 3: Advanced MCP Logging Organization (OPTIONAL)
**Goal**: Build upon v0.0.19 MCP logging with enhanced structure and diagnostics

#### 3.1 Hierarchical Log Structure (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Implement tree-based log visualization for MCP operations
- [ ] Add operation context with parent-child relationships
- [ ] Create indented log format for better readability
- [ ] Add timestamp and duration for each operation

#### 3.2 MCP Performance Metrics (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Success/failure rate calculation per server
- [ ] Request throughput monitoring
- [ ] Tool usage frequency analysis

#### 3.3 Enhanced Error Diagnostics (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Detailed error context with full stack traces
- [ ] Retry attempt logging with exponential backoff details
- [ ] Common error pattern detection
- [ ] Suggested fixes in error messages

### üéØ Milestone 4: Enhanced Debugging & Display (OPTIONAL)
**Goal**: Improve terminal display handling for long outputs and enhance debugging experience

#### 4.1 Scroll Support Implementation (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Detect when output exceeds terminal height
- [ ] Implement scrollable view with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add scroll indicators (position bar, line numbers)
- [ ] Support for different terminal emulators

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- Arrow keys: Line-by-line scrolling
- Page Up/Down: Page scrolling
- Home/End: Jump to start/end
- `/`: Search within output
- `n`/`N`: Next/previous search result
